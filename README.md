Model Driven Software Development (https://fagbesk.sam.sdu.dk/?fag_id=32672) course exercises and assignments.

This is the first assignment which will be centered around an internal domain specific language, for a Boom Barrier state machine.

I have chosen to make use of Ulrik's (subject teacher) code as inspiration, which can be found at https://github.com/ulrikpaghschultz/MDSD/tree/master/src/statemachine
